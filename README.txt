Menalam: A Telehealth Platform for Women with Disabilities

Menalam —  named after a female goddess of health and healing in Filipino mythology — is a telehealth platform for women with disabilities primarily geared towards those living in rural areas, where there is no access to practitioners and specialists for PWDs. The mobile application provides convenient virtual visits to the doctor, time-saving medical care, efficient medical data storage and management, and better facilitation of administrative operations. Using the data collected from market studies, Flutter technology was used to design and create the application that provides remote quality health services for WWDs.
